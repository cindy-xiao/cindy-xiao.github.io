				<p> I designed a custom delay-locked loop (DLL) - wrote RTL code in Verilog, configured custom environment setup, synthesized the design using Synopsys Design Compiler, performed place and route of the design using Synopsys ICC II, and analyzed timing of the design using Synopsys Primetime. </p>
				<p>I also wrote tcl scripts for placing custom macro cells across 4 IP blocks to improve floorplan congestion and logic connectivity.</p>

				<p> The real time harmonizer allows a single user to produce multiple sounds at once, which allows the user to experiment with different harmonies and broadens their range of expression. The user can also add a reverb and phasor effect to the output.</p>
				<p> The project won an award in the electrical engineering category at the senior design expo with judges from industry.

				<p>I worked on a 32nm cryptography ASIC, writing python scripts to automate DRC cleanup and wiring path optimization for timing closure of hierarchical blocks, and designed and implemented methodology improvements in Python and Tcl. I also worked on ten hierarchical blocks from synthesis through to DRC and LVS cleanup.
